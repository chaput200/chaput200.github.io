
# GITHUB.IO PORTFOLIO WEBSITE

### SUMMARY:

- Used githubâ€™s website capabilities to create a githib.io page for a portfolio website.
- Used HTML & CSS & Javascript to design the webpage.
- For each project I wanted to showcase, I embedded the GitHub repository link to redirect the user after clicking the snapshot of the project displayed on the project portfolio page. 
- Embedded my resume as a downloadable PDF on the contact page.
- Programmed the GitHub tab to redirect to my GitHub repository for my portfolio website when clicked.
