					<p class="about">Thanks for taking an interest in me. This is my webpage! This is a space for me to showcase my coding skills, art work, and some fun things in my life. My resume can also be accessed through the menu bar. Below you can find past assignments that show my capabilities with corresponding information to each. Now this is just some information about me! I am nineteen years old, and I am currently enrolled at Indiana University. I am studying computer science and hope to code for a tech company in the future! I did competitive cheerleading for nine years, and those experiences taught me so much. Some of my hobbies include photography and video editing. Some impressive facts include graduating from high school an entire year early, and I have competed in the cheerleading world championship four years in a row. </p>
